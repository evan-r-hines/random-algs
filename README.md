# Random Algorithms

This is just a repository of solutions to random algorithm problems and interview questions that I run across.


* Additive Strings - `O(n)` A string is additive if it is of the form `s = a_1|a_2|a_3...|a_n` where `a_n = a_(n-1) + a_(n-2)` for all N. `additive.py` gives a function that returns true iff `s` is additive.

2. TopK - `O(n)` - Find the top k values by frequency in a list

3. Merge - `O(n * n log n)` - Merge all overlapping intervals
